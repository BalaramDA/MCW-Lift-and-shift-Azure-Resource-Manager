# Azure Resource Manager introduction to DSC

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will learn how to author a Desired State Configuration using Powershell DSC.  This lab will also cover applying DSC to a virtual machine using virtual machine extensions, how to verify DSC has been applied successfully, and how to troubleshoot DSC.

## Exercise 1: Create Powershell Desired State Configuration

Duration: 10 minutes

In this exercise, you will create a powershell Desired State Configuration (DSC) and apply the configuration manually.

### Task 1: Write an HTML file

1. In your root folder, create a folder named `test`.

2. In a text editor, type the following text:

```html
<head></head>
<body>
<p>Hello World!</p>
</body>
```

3. Save this as `index.htm` in the `test` folder you created earlier.

### Task 2: Write the configuration

1. In the VM created in the 'Before hands on lab...' open PowerShell ISE and type the following:

```powershell
Configuration WebsiteTest {

    # Import the module that contains the resources we're using.
    Import-DscResource -ModuleName PsDesiredStateConfiguration

    # The Node statement specifies which targets this configuration will be applied to.
    Node 'localhost' {

        # The first resource block ensures that the Web-Server (IIS) feature is enabled.
        WindowsFeature WebServer {
            Ensure = "Present"
            Name   = "Web-Server"
        }

        # The second resource block ensures that the website content copied to the website root folder.
        File WebsiteContent {
            Ensure = 'Present'
            SourcePath = 'c:\test\index.htm'
            DestinationPath = 'c:\inetpub\wwwroot'
        }
    }
}
```

2. Save the file as `WebsiteTest.ps1`.

### Task 3: Compile the configuration

1. To compile the configuration, run WebsiteTest.ps1.  This places the function in a global scope.

```powershell
PS C:\ConfigurationTest>. .\WebsiteTest.ps1
```
2. Next, run the function by entering it's name.  The output will be a MOF file.

```powershell
PS C:\ConfigurationTest>WebsiteTest
Directory: C:\ConfigurationTest\WebsiteTest
Mode                LastWriteTime         Length Name                                                              
----                -------------         ------ ----                                                              
-a----        7/24/2018  11:58 PM           2756 localhost.mof  
```

### Task 4: Apply the configuration and verify status

1. Apply the configuraiton by running the following command:

```powershell
PS C:\ConfigurationTest> Start-DscConfiguration .\WebsiteTest
```
2. It will take a few minutes for the configuration to apply.  Get the status of the configuration by running the following command.

```powershell
Get-DscConfigurationStatus
```
3. Once the status shows 'Success', browse to http://locahost .

4. Alternatively, DSC status can be retrieved by examining the Windows Event Viewer. DSC events are in: Applications and Services Logs/Microsoft/Windows/Desired State Configuration.

### Task 5: Cleanup

The local DSC configuration will be removed so that it can be applied through Azure VM extensions in Exercise 2.

1. In PowerShell, run the following command:

```powershell
Remove-DscConfigurationDocument -Stage Current
```

2. The previous step removed the .mof document.  The individual server configuration must still be reverted.  To do this, run the following command:

```powershell
Uninstall-WindowsFeature Web-Server
```

3. Restart the server.

## Exercise 2: Deploy DSC using Azure Virtual Machine extensions

Duration: 10 minutes

In this exercise, you will apply the DSC from Exercise 1 using the Azure VM extension for DSC.

### Task 1: Package the DSC configuration script

The VM extension for PowerShell DSC requires that the configuration script be provided in a .zip file.

1. Open Powershell, navigate to the C:\ConfigurationTest folder and run the following command:

```powershell
PS C:\ConfigurationTest>compress-archive WebsiteTest.ps1 -DestinationPath WebsiteTest.zip
```

### Task 2: Add and configure the VM extenion

1. Log into the portal.azure.com.

2. Under Resource Groups, click on **OPSLABRG**.

3. Within the **OPSLABRG** Resource Group, click on the LABVM.

4. In the Virtual Machine blade, under settings, click on Extensions.

    ![VM Extenions](images/DSC/extensions.png "VM Extensions")

 5. In the Extensions blade, click on + Add.

     ![VM Extenions](images/DSC/addextension.png "Add VM Extension")

 6. In the New Resource blade, click on PowerShell Desired State Configuration.
 
     ![VM Extenions](images/DSC/powershelldscextension.png "PowerShell DSC extension")

 7. In the blade that opens, click Create.

 8. In the Install extension blade that opens enter the following information and click OK:

    -   Configuration Modules or Script: Select the ZIP file created in Task 1: **WebsiteTest.zip**.

    -   Module-qualified Name of Configuration: **WebsiteTest.ps1\WebsiteTest**

    -   Version: **2.76**

    -   Auto Upgrade Minor Version: **Yes**

    ![VM DSC Extension](images/DSC/powershelldscextensionconfig.png)

9. It will take 2-3 minutes for the deployment to complete successfully and for the extension to show as **Provisioning succeeded**

![DSC Extension Status](images/DSC/provisioningstatus.png)

10. Once provisioning is complete, verify by running the PowerShell command below and by browsing to http://localhost.

```powershell
PS C:\ConfigurationTest> Get-DscConfigurationStatus
```
